<h1>An Electron App for Google Messages</h1>

In the past, there was a similar app but now it's giving warnings about deprecated packages so I wrote a new one or made nativefier write it for me.

If you'd like to build::

<ol>
    <li>Install Node and NPM</li>
    <li>Navigate to this repository and run one of the commands listed in the package.json</li>
    <ul>
        <li>node npm mac</li>
        <li>node npm linux</li>
        <li>node npm windows</li>
        <li>node npm windows:tray</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
