<h1>An Electron App for Google Messages</h1>

In the past, there was a similar app but now it's giving warnings about deprecated packages so I wrote a new one or made nativefier write it for me.

If you'd like to build (I'll test these later on a VM to see how far off I am):

<ol>
    <li>I'll fill this in later, I don't fully understand how packages work on here but I'd assume...</li>
    <li>Install Node and NPM</li>
    <li>Navigate to this repository and run one of the commands listed in the package.json</li>
</ol>
